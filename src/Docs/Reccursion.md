# Reccursion

## Requirements
- How do we prevent a stack overflow caused by a stack print. 
    - Elixir creates the Tail Recursion design
    this is where we add a variable that's passed on to the next call 
    because this variable is passed on to the next call then the stack somehow
    solves the stack overflow
