# Compound Statements
A compound statement is a statement that can be written on the same line but wil a separator that makes sense.
This becomes beneficial when you wan't to compress code. to avoid unnecessary spaces and new lines.
Having this as a compound statement provides for a compression level by removing tabs and spaces
and replacing them with less memory intense characters.

```Unify
val a=12,val b=c,c++,a+=c/*,**/
```
Spaces between variable declaration and variable name are still not compressible as this would lose it's 
meaning.
